Add (empty) files here with the exact name as in Mods to skip them.
Create a new, empty text file and rename it to e.g. 'foobar.ts4script' (make sure to replace the .txt suffix with .package).
Or on the command line: `echo >foobar.ts4script` in this directory, don't delete the original mod.

In case you have enough disk space you may simply copy the whole .ts4script file here, the content/size doesn't matter.

There are no further checks for the sha256sum / integrity of the mod as it makes it only harder to add files here and will not improve security.
One who can add a file here can also add its md5sum.

For more security use an administrative account and make the `privacy_protector` read-only for a normal user.
This will effectively prevent mods from adding themselves in this directory.
