Add (empty) files here with the exact name as in Mods to skip them.
Create a new, empty text file and rename it to eg. 'andrew_poseplayer.ts4script' (make sure to remove the .txt suffix).
Or on the command line: `echo >andrew_poseplayer.ts4script` in this directory, don't delete the original mod.

In case you have enough disk space you may simply copy the whole .ts4script file here, it doesn't really matter.

There are no further checks for the sha256sum / integrity of the mod as it makes it only harder to add files here and will not improve security at all.
